  summary: Add telemetry data
  description: |
    Associate telemetry data with a `Shipment`. The telemetry payload must be signed and encoded as a [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515).
    An active AXLE certificate must be used to sign this JWS, and the certificate ID must be included in the headers as `kid`.

    A JSON Schema specification for the telemetry data payload format is located at [schema.shipchain.io](http://schema.shipchain.io/1.2.4/telemetry.json)

    An example of a raw payload:
    ```
    {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "timestamp": "2018-08-22T17:44:39.874352",
      "device_id": "1243d23b-e2fc-475a-8290-0e4f53479553"
      "sensor_id": "1243d23b-e2fc-475a-8290-0e4f53479553"
      "hardware_id": "1243d23b-e2fc-475a-8290-0e4f53479553"
      "value": 123.45
    }
    ```
